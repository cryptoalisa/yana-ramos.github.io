  <div class="text">Waxing is hair removal from the root. New hair will not grow back
    in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will
    start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a
    different human hair growth cycle. Our wax is specially formulated to provide
    delicate, deep & effective hair removal. Our luxurious hard wax requires no
    strip and is made of plant based ingredients and elastomers, essential to
    ensure the highest quality of hair removal results. Our organic hard wax is safe;
    less painful, hygienic and cost effective leaving your skin smooth compared<br> to other
    hair removal treatments available today.
