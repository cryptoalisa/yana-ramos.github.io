    The lash lift procedure has revolutionised old, inadequate perming techniques.
    Using silicone pads instead of perm rods, this new technique can lift, straighten or curl,
    and lengthen your own natural lashes to create a brighter, fuller, wide eyed look.
    No need for extensions and the associated aftercare, this will last you
    6-8 weeks and can be combined with a tint to leave the mascara behind.
    Lash lifting is a new generation of lash perm which makes it possible
    to curl natural lashes from the root straightly upward to maximize
    expressing natural lash length. Most clients don’t realize that they have
    long natural lashes, and they don’t need to attach fake lashes.
    That is why many lash extension lovers turn into lash lift lovers.
    No need to maintain for 2 months, so save a lot of money and time!
    No need a lash curler and mascara every morning, so enjoy morning
    coffee with free time! No need an adhesive which causes a cancer or
    other types of side effects, so keep in good health! <br>No need
    a fake lashes, so be a true natural beauty!<br><br>In order to book in appointment
