  <div class="text">Microblading is a semi-permanent tattooing technique that
    creates hairlike strokes to fill in sparse or thinning brows. The practice
    aims to give you an effortless full brow ― no need for expensive brow pencils
    or gels. It lasts for one to three years depending on your skin and lifestyle.
    Microblading does require touchups yearly or bi-yearly, but at least you won’t
    be stuck forever with eyebrows that you don’t like, in case you don’t like how
    yours come out.
    Most people require two sessions to get their ideal brow.
    They have to come back four weeks later because, depending on their
    skin type, their skin may push out a bit of ink and in some places
    the hair strokes won’t be as saturated as we want them. You can tell
    if there’s minor<br> imperfections after the first session
    that need to be filled in.
